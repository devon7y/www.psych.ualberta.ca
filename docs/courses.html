<h3>Jeremy Caplan's teaching for 2025/2026:</h3><br>

  <h4>Winter, 2026, PSYCH 403 B07 and PSYCH 505 B08: Research on
Enhancing Memory</h4>
  <p style="color:red"><b><i>(open to people from all departments/faculties/colleges)</i></b><p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> One of the most obvious goals of
the study of human memory is to enhance it. There are many ideas on
how to do this, but very little actual success. In this seminar-format
course we will read, discuss and argue about published research on a
diverse range of behavioural strategies. The goal is to understand the
state of the art across all techniques, to form our own critical
opinions about this work, and figure out together what needs to be
done next, with primary focus on human episodic memory for arbitrary
new information like randomly constructed lists.
</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> We will read articles and discuss them,
led by students. A term project includes oral presentations and a
final short paper proposing a compelling, novel experiment on this
topic.
</p>
  <p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong>
I am happy to waive formal pre-requisites if you have the pertinent pre-requisite knowledge:<br>
Substantial knowledge of experimental psychology of memory (such as PSYCO 350) and a good intuitive understanding of basic statistical tests, how to apply them and how to understand reports of those statistical tests. Simply having taken psychology courses previously is not a firm requirement. Note that for qualified students from other departments, Psychology course pre-requisites might be waived (consult the Instructor). Try out this <b>self-quiz</b> to assess
your preparedness for this course or identify areas to read up on  (if most
of these are hard work, the course will be more challenging than
necessary):

<ul>
<li> Sketch a graph (fully labelled) of your favourite memory experimental result and explain how the plot supports the researchers' conclusions.
<li> Explain what a <b>hypothesis</b> is, and how it differs from a
topic, an expectation or a research question.
<li> What does a t test actually test?
<li> When do you need to use an ANOVA?
<li> What is a Pearson correlation? What does it mean if a correlation is positive, zero or negative?
<li> What is a p value and how does it relate to false positives and false negatives?
</ul>
  <p><p><br><br>

	  
<h4>Winter, 2026, PSYCH 473 and PSYCH 576: Cognitive Neuroscience</h4>
<p style="color:red"><b><i>(open to people from all departments/faculties/colleges)</i></b><p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Brain basis of human cognition
studied using a diverse range of techniques, with a focus on measures
of brain activity such as functional neuroimaging and
electrophysiology recorded during behavioural tasks. Designed for
graduate and senior undergraduate students who are conducting
cognitive neuroscience research.
</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong>
  We will read articles and discuss them, led by students. Students will write hypothetical editorial letters for the articles. Students will present their own research or proposals. We will do hands-on analyses of sample brain-activity data.
</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong>
I am happy to waive formal pre-requisites if you have the pertinent pre-requisite knowledge:<br>
Basic knowledge of cognitive psychology and basic neuroscience and
commfort reading and critiquing original research articles. Although
we will work through the methods together, basic knowledge of
cognitive neuroscience (e.g., EEG, fMRI and related topics) is also
important. Have a look at recent articles in the Journal of Cognitive
Neuroscience and try out this <b>self-quiz</b> to assess your
preparedness for this course or identify areas to read up on (if most
of these are hard work, the course will be more challenging than
necessary):

				  <ul>
<li> Sketch a graph (fully labelled) of your favourite experimental psychology result and explain how the plot supports the researchers' conclusions.
<li> Explain what a <b>hypothesis</b> is, and how it differs from a
topic, an expectation or a research question.
<li> What does a t test actually test?
<li> When do you need to use an ANOVA?
<li> What is a Pearson correlation? What does it mean if a correlation is positive, zero or negative?
<li> What is a p value and how does it relate to false positives and false negatives?
<li> What is the difference between these units: V, mV and uV?
<li> What do EEG and fMRI measure? How do people think that relates to
neuronal activity?
<li> What is the difference between MRI and fMRI?
<li> What is an ERP, and how does that relate to EEG?
<li> Sketch your favourite EEG or fMRI result, and explain what we learn from it
</ul>

    <!--    <h4>Winter, 2024, PSYCH 403 A3 and 505: Replication Crisis</h4>
    <p style="color:red"><b><i>(open to people from all departments)</i></b><p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Replication Crisis is a hot-button term that has gotten some people riled up and other people defensive. It has been used to hold people to account and to dismiss swaths of research. The goal of this seminar is to have thoughtful, considered discussions based on readings from multiple perspectives to develop a balanced view of the various phenomena the term evokes. This includes file-drawer problems, selective reporting, publication bias, replication attempts, pre-registration and data-sharing, as well as social and cultural factors that inform these topics. We will discuss the statistics and mathematical methods for identifying publication bias in a field. If all goes well, we will end up with a nuanced understanding of both real and exaggerated problems and a repertoire of practices we can draw upon and adapt to our own research values and style.
</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> We will read articles and discuss them, led by students. A term project includes oral presentations and a final short paper based on a related practical activity.
</p>
<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Because the course is about
research, <b>*** experience conducting research and collecting data is
required ***</b> (but any topic or field of research is
fine). Otherwise the concepts are way too abstract and needlessly
difficult. Graduate students, honours students and people doing
research via independent studies in any department are
enthusiastically welcomed.  Try out this <b>self-quiz</b> to assess
your preparedness for this course or identify areas to read up on:

<ul>
<li> What does a t test actually test?
<li> When do you need to use an ANOVA?
<li> What is a Pearson correlation? What does it mean if a correlation is positive, zero or negative?
<li> What is a p value and how does it relate to false positives and false negatives?
<li> What is a Bayes Factor?
<li> Sketch and explain your favourite result experimental psychology result 
</ul>

				    cognitive psychology, and explain
				    how the plot supports the

				    and how it differs from a topic,
				    an expectation or a research
				    question.

				    potential and explain how it is generated
				    <li> What is voltage and why is
				    there a voltage difference between

<li> When do you need to use an ANOVA?
<li> What is a Pearson correlation? What does it mean if a correlation is positive, zero or negative?
<li> What is a p value and how does it relate to false positives and
				    false negatives?
<li> What is the difference between these units: V, mV and uV? s and
